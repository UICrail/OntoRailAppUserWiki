OntoRail (https://ontorail.org) is a project initiated at UIC (https://uic.org), the International Union of Railways, aimed at fulfilling two main goals:

* Leverage ontologies as a means to consolidate and enrich Railways Systems Modelling knowledge into an Encyclopedia
* Provide ontology-based tools to promote and facilitate convergence and federation between models of the railways domain.
  * OntoRail: Browsing of ontologies and linking between ontologies
  * OntoDiff: Report differences between version of an ontology
  * OntoDic: An Ontolex-backed glossary for the railway domain
